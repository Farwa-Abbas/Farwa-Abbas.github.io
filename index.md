## About Me

I am currently working as a PhD student at the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dr. Wei Dai](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/wei.dai1) in Communications and Signal Processing Research Group. Previously, I have worked as a Research Associate at Center of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Science (CACTuS) Lab at [Information Technology University (ITU)](https://itu.edu.pk/), Lahore, Pakistan. I have been a receipient of a prestigious [national scholarship](https://www.peef.org.pk/phd-scholarships-finalawardlist-2019) from my home country to support my doctoral studies abroad. I have graduated with a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/) in 2019 with a specialisation in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. Prior to that, I have completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from [University of Engineering and Technology (UET)](https://www.uet.edu.pk/home/), Lahore in 2017.
